    <p>  From a simple and clean promotional site to a complete web experience, you’ve come to the right place. Whether
      it’s enhanced performance, improved brand recognition, or a fun new user interface, I can help with that.
    </p>
      <p>When you hire me to design your website, you get a "full-stack" developer with both client-side and server-side
        knowledge, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single page web-apps</li>
      <li>Multi-page websites</li>
      <li>Interactive elements</li>
      <li>Database integration</li>
      <li>eStore integration</li>
      <li>User maintenance (login/signup/etc.)</li>
      <li>Wordpress for premade templates</li>
      <li>Custom Server Routing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The technical side is important, but many clients have trouble with developers who speak using buzzwords or
      tech-speak. With me as your web designer, you won’t have to worry. I bring 16 years of customer service
      experience. I will ensure you know and—more importantly—understand exactly what you’re getting.

      Sometimes what you need is just to ask questions, but you don’t have a dedicated IT person and you don't know
      where to start. If this sounds like you, then I can help!</p>

    <p>
      I offer hourly or contracted tech consultation services, covering a wide variety of topics including:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Website and e-mail hosting</li>
        <li>Database and server integrations</li>
        <li>Software integrations and upgrades</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      As an independent contractor, I work for you—and you alone. Unlike software company representatives, I have no
      motive to push you towards a specific product or brand. If the product isn't right for you, I'll tell you why
      and, just as importantly, offer you alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know how important your time is, and your deadlines are my deadlines. My work experience includes extensive
      knowledge in project and personnel management. Communication is at the forefront of any partnership, and I pride
      myself in delivery accurate and timely updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final bonus, I am both a Certified ScrumMaster® and a Certified Scrum Product Owner® through the
      Scrum Alliance. If your company or team follows Agile software development, I can easily adapt to your
      development process.

    <p>
      Of all my talents, my true passion lies in full-stack development. Most of my independent work is done using a
      MEAN stack, but I also have experience with Java and Ruby as well as passing knowledge of several other languages
      and frameworks. I also love learning new tech stacks and development techniques. My viewpoint has always been:
      "Why pigeonhole yourself into only knowing one thing?"
    </p>

    <p>
      I am available for both long-term and short-term contracts. With over 15 years experience working in a team
      environment, I can easily adapt to any structure your workplace utilizes. As a Certified ScrumMaster® and a
      Certified Scrum Product Owner®, I can adapt to a pre-existing Agile work environment. I can also fill either role,
      bringing along over 10 years of leadership experience.
