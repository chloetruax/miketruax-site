        <div class="panel-body">The first six months offered the challenge I needed and I loved
            the ability to grow as a leader and learn new tasks and skills. The unfortunate part was that after
            roughly seven months, I felt like the challenge was gone. My hope was that as I continued to move
            up in the company, more challenges would arise and I wouldn’t feel like I was missing something
            from my professional life. In roughly February, 2016, I decided that I wanted to do more with my
            life and set out on a new path.
            My new plan was to keep working at Whole Foods and learn new aspects of programming in my spare
            time. Unfortunately, my ASTL job required long work hours on my feet. After an exhausting day, programming
            took a back seat to resting up for the next day’s grind. So, after much soul-searching and financial
            considerations, in April of 2016, I left a successful almost 12-year career in the grocery business to
            focus on computer programming. Since that time, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            jQuery, AngularJS (used to program portions of this site), Java, and even some Ruby on Rails.
            I have also jumped headfirst into the Agile methodology,
            receiving certifications as both a Certified ScrumMaster and Product Owner through Scrum Alliance. It took
            me 13
            years to realize this truth: programming is what I always wanted to do. A much wiser adult regrets the
            decisions of that impetuous 18-year old, but my life has had many rewards. I am already more than happy with
            my
            new career choice.
