            I had always been good at school (with the exception of gym -- which was a major reason I wasn’t a
            co-valedictorian), so when I finally set my sights on computers, I put all my effort into it. I received
            two “full ride” scholarships (one of which being the coveted Walter Scott Scolarship) to the University of
            Nebraska – Omaha.
            A third scholarship also covered
            approximately one third of the yearly tuition. So being an intelligent 18-year-old, I aced all of my
            classes and graduated with honors… wait, no I didn’t. At the end of my freshman year in college, I began
            to reconsider my decision to pursue a degree in computer programming. I still loved it and my classes,
            but I asked myself: “What if I didn’t enjoy this as a life’s career?” Rather than look at things rationally
            or even stick with computer programming because I effectively was going to college free, I decided that I
            should leave college and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I chalk up that decision to
            18-year-old
            Mike being an idiot, although to be fair, isn’t idiot somewhat synonymous with being 18? As an interesting
            aside, of all the friends I made at UNO who were majoring in computer science, only one works in the field
            (he’s a senior UX architect at a major company). Everyone else left school before finishing. So there I was
            in 2002.
            I was a “20 something” who walked away from two full-ride scholarships.
            Like many people without a college degree, my options were limited.
