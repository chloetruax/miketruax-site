                I began work with a local grocer
                in Omaha, NE in the deli. After moving up to a “back office” position, I was offered a job at another
                grocery chain -- Wild Oats. This began my first foray into the world of natural and organic grocery
                stores. During this time, I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do as an adult, but I never
                lost my passion for programming.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2005, Whole Foods announced it was going to open a store in Omaha. Whole Foods
                was a huge competitor for Wild Oats, but offered much better benefits. One of my managers at Wild Oats
                took a job with Whole Foods and offered me a buyer position there because he was impressed with my
                previous work. At the time, I believed the position would give me an opportunity to save money and work
                towards returning to school. One of the best things about working with Whole Foods was also one of the
                worst: The pay was solid and there were enough opportunities for growth that I ended up putting off
                returning to school while I climbed the “corporate ladder.” During the time at Omaha, I worked my way up
                to an associate team leader position and helped in different capacities storewide at other locations
                region-wide. When I was informed that a produce team leader position (produce manager) was available at
                a new Whole Foods store in Lincoln, I jumped at the opportunity.</p>
            <p>Moving to Lincoln was arguably one of the best decisions I have ever made. Not only did I
                receive a promotion and a brand new set of skills, it also forced me to grow as a person. My
                professional and personal growth helped me become the confident adult I am today. After roughly a
                year of the store being open, I applied for a promotion to associate store team leader (effectively
                assistant store manager). At the time I had done everything I could do as a team leader and was
                looking for more of a challenge.
