  <div class="col-xs-12 container-box  skills-box">
    <p>
      My philosophy is to bring the knowledge I have gained working as both
      a team leader and a team member to any project I approach. I originally gave up a career to pursue programming full-time
      so I give everything I have to each project as this is literally my dream job. I am always eager to show everyone
      I work with my talents and what I am truly capable of. No task is too big when you're following your dream, and I attack
      every challenge that is given to me with that mentality. I look forward to hearing from you and how I can help your brand
      grow in whatever capacity that may entail. I'm not na√Øve enough to think that passion is all that you're looking for however.
      I also bring experience dealing with large projects with hard deadlines and high expectations. I've dealt with profit and
      loss statements for years and know how important getting done on time and on budget is, whether you're trying to grow your
      business or maintain the track record you have already established
