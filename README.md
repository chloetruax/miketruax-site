This is the repo for my professional site. Originally built using AngularJS,
 it's since been update to include the following technologies:
  * HTML5 
  * Bootstrap with SCSS for design
  * Angular4
  * NGRX, Stores, and Reducers (specifically for food blog)
  * Node.JS with Express for backend via NGINIX (host requirement)
  * API built via MySQL for recipe retrieval
  * Webpack (ease of use through AngularCLI) for building
 
 ## Current Functionality
 
 Currently, this site hosts all of my simple portfolio items as sub-components. 
 Most of the por****tfolio objects originally started as simple JS which was
 then converted to Angular4 but not yet built into their own components.
 
 ## Planned Functionality
 
 In addition to linking any future projects, I have future plans to add recipe 
 submission and voting for any new recipes to allow more interaction for users.
