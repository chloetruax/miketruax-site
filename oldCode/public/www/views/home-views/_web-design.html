                Iterative development to ensure constant delivery. This means you can see it as it's being built and can
                test sections as they're completed instead of waiting for 100% delivery

                Open and honest discussions with clients. I bring 12 years of leadership experience and know how to
                treat people with respect and professionalism.
                If it's not something we can do, we won't waste your time in claiming we can. If it's not something that
                can be done at ALL, we'll be up front and find a solution
                that works for you.

                We avoid 'tech jargon'. If we start using terms you don't know, ask! Our goal is that you only agree on
                a suggestion because YOU feel it's the best
                option, not because we talked you into it.
