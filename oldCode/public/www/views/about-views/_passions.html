            I have too many passions to be able to include everything here. Science and technology are probably
            at the top of the list. In my free time, I can’t read enough about physics. Gravitational time dilation
            and relativity are probably my all-time favorite physics subjects. In my opinion, better funding and
            education for science and math should be at the forefront of any talk about primary education. I’m also
            very passionate about animal rights -- a cause that I feel is critical for the future of humanity.
            As is evident by the fact that I have a food blog of my favorite recipes, I thoroughly enjoy cooking.
            While my wife and I have been vegetarian for some time, I am more than happy to discuss any type of food
            with anyone! Food is one of the great equalizers; everyone needs to eat, and everyone enjoys good food.
            Pies and candies are my favorites to cook. Candy making is more science than art (unlike some cooking)
            and appeals to me a lot more. If you want to talk food or have any suggestions for recipes, feel free to
            reach out to me!
            Foreign languages fascinate me. I tend to pick up little snippets of languages like a sponge and have
            more recently decided to use that skill to become fluent in several languages. Currently, I am at a
            conversational
            / intermediate level in Spanish, and I am working towards fluency in Croatian. One of the great things about
            learning foreign languages is that they not only open new opportunities, but the act of learning greatly
            improves
            other brain functions. My current track for foreign language learning is this: Croatian (which has the added
            benefit of effectively also teaching you Bosnian and Serbian); regain fluency in Spanish; then fluency in
            German.
            After my goals are met, I am excited for the future. After that, the future is wide open. If you have any
            suggestions, I would be more than happy to hear them!
